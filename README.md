# Postman-Object-Models
Demo of how to create and use Postman Object Models. 

## simpleAPI
Is a simple API implemented in node.js used with the postman collection. 

I would open it in VS Code, then run ```npm install``` from the project folder (one time only) and then run the start script in the NPM scripts tab each time you want start the server. 

You can check it is running by browsing to http://localhost:5000/api/v1/info. 

## Postman Collection & Environment files
Import these into Postman and select the TestingMind environment. 

Then you should be able to run the entire collection, or just one of the folders with the Collection Runner. 

Alternatively, in the Postman UI you can run each individual request in the order listed in a folder.
